Stock market forecasting based on computational intelligence models have been part of stock trading systems for the last few decades. At the same time, more financial instruments, such as ETFs, options, leveraged systems (like forex) have been introduced for individual investors and traders. As a result, trading systems based on autonomous intelligent decision making models are getting more attention in various different financial markets globally [1].

In recent years, deep learning based prediction/classification models started emerging as the best performance achievers in various applications, outperforming classical computational intelligence methods like SVM. However, image processing and vision based problems dominate the type of applications that these deep learning models outperform the other techniques [2].

In literature, deep learning methods have started appearing on financial studies. There are some implementations of deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural network (RNN) [3], convolutional neural network (CNN) [4], and long short term memory (LSTM) [5]. In particular, the application of deep neural networks on financial forecasting models have been very limited.
